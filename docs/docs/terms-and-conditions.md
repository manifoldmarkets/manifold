The same rule and requirement applies to Manifold.

The parties shall use their best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement and engage in good faith negotiations which shall be a condition to either party initiating an arbitration claim as provided in these Terms. If the parties do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution begins, then either party may initiate binding arbitration as the sole means to resolve claims, subject to these Terms. The aforementioned informal dispute resolution process is a prerequisite and condition precedent to commencing any formal dispute resolution proceeding, including litigation if You have successfully opt-out of the arbitration agreement. The parties agree that any relevant limitations period and filing fees or other deadlines will be tolled solely by the amount of time the parties initiate and engage in this informal dispute resolution process.

Regardless of whether you decide to opt out of arbitration, pursuant to this Agreement, the terms set forth in this Section 10.3 Initial Dispute Resolution shall remain in full force and effect.

**12.4. INITIATING ARBITRATION**

Following the conclusion of the initial dispute resolution process required by this Agreement, you may seek arbitration of a Dispute in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. The arbitration shall be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) pursuant to its Consumer Arbitration Rules (“AAA Rules”), except as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules are available on the AAA’s website www.adr.org, or by calling the AAA at (800) 778-7879, or its then current telephone number as provided on its web site, or by sending a written request to: The American Arbitration Association, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043.  In the event the AAA is unavailable or unwilling to hear the dispute in accordance with this Agreement, the parties shall agree to, or a court shall select, another arbitration provider.

By signing a demand for arbitration, a party certifies, to the best of their knowledge, information, and belief, formed after an inquiry reasonable under the circumstances, that: (i) the demand for arbitration is not being presented for any improper purpose, such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution; (ii) the claims and other legal contentions are warranted by existing law or by a nonfrivolous argument for extending, modifying, or reversing existing law or for establishing new law; and (iii) the factual contentions have evidentiary support or, if specifically so identified, will likely have evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for further investigation or discovery. The Arbitrator shall be authorized to afford any relief or impose any sanctions available under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 or any applicable state law for either party’s violation of this requirement.

You should take reasonable steps to conduct further research and to consult with counsel (at your expense) regarding the consequences of your decision.

**12.6. LOCATION OF ARBITRATION & APPLICABLE RULES**

You and Manifold agree that:

(a) provided the Dispute involves *solely individual claims* for damages in accordance with the Agreement, the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) will administer the arbitration under its Consumer Rules in effect at the time arbitration is sought, available at [www.adr.org](https://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.adr.org/&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726521610021839&usg=AOvVaw3YNPaWtZ6mrDKE9sNikiGm), and the arbitration shall be conducted via telephone or other remote electronic means.  However, the parties agree: to select an arbitrator pursuant to the procedure set forth in R-12 of the Commercial Part Rules (instead of the Consumer Part Rules); that the AAA will only include arbitrators from the AAA National Registry Commercial Part list on the parties’ arbitrator selection list (instead of the Consumer list); and the AAA will only include arbitrators who are practicing attorneys or retired federal court judges who have at least ten years of substantive expertise in litigating and resolving of complex business disputes, including motions to compel arbitration and litigation or adjudication regarding whether disputes are arbitrable.‍

(b) You and Manifold agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual basis and neither you nor Manifold may bring a claim as a part of a Collective Arbitration.

(i) Without limiting the generality of the Agreement, and as an example only, a claim to resolve a Dispute against Manifold will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if: (a) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are pending concurrently by or on behalf of one or more claimants; and (b) counsel for the two or more claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate in any way across the arbitrations.‍

(c) If, notwithstanding the terms of this Agreement, to the extent a party attempts to assert any claims or seek relief on behalf of or for the use of other persons or a class under any theory, or in which injunctive relief is sought by a party that would significantly impact other Manifold users or the operation of the Platform, the Commercial Arbitration Rules shall apply and, as appropriate, the Supplementary Rules for Class Action of the AAA may apply.

(d) the applicable AAA rules will govern payment of all arbitration fees.

(e) except as otherwise may be required by the AAA Rules, the arbitration will be held in Wilmington, Delaware.

(f) the arbitrator shall be authorized to award any remedies, including injunctive relief, that would be available in an individual lawsuit and that are not waivable under applicable law, however, any relief must be individualized to you and shall not affect any other persons.

(g) except as and to the extent otherwise may be required by law, the arbitration proceeding, pleadings, and any award shall be confidential, except as may be necessary in connection with a court application for a preliminary remedy, a judicial challenge to an award or its enforcement.

**12.7. WAIVER OF CLASS RELIEF AND COLLECTIVE ACTION**

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR Manifold SHALL BE ENTITLED TO BRING, CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR PARTICIPATE IN ANY COLLECTIVE ARBITRATION OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY. YOU MAY ONLY ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY AND FOR YOUR OWN LOSSES ONLY. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, YOU MAY NOT PROCEED IN ARBITRATION OR COURT AS A CLASS REPRESENTATIVE, MEMBER OR PART OF ANY PROPOSED CLASS, COLLECTIVE ACTION OR MASS ARBITRATION, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL SUIT OR ANY REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, OR OTHERWISE SEEK TO RECOVER ON BEHALF OF OTHERS OR FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS IN ANY TYPE OF CLAIM OR ACTION. YOU AND Manifold ARE EACH WAIVING RESPECTIVE RIGHTS TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN ANY PAST, PENDING OR FUTURE CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING, INCLUDING ANY EXISTING AS OF THE DATE YOU AGREED TO THIS AGREEMENT. YOU ALSO EXPRESSLY WAIVE AND RELEASE, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT AVAILABLE AT LAW, ANY CLAIM PURPORTED TO BE ASSERTED BY ANY OTHER PERSON ON YOUR BEHALF OR FOR YOUR USE OR BENEFIT.

**12.8. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL.**

EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE PLATFORM OR SERVICES OR ANY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR ANY OTHER THEORY.

**12.9. SEVERABILITY**

This Agreement applies solely to the extent permitted by law. If for any reason any provision of this Agreement or portion thereof, is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part of this Agreement will be deemed severable and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of the remainder of this Agreement which shall continue in full force and effect. The parties agree further that if any part of this Agreement is deemed to be illegal, invalid, void or for any reason unenforceable, that the invalid or unenforceable provision should, to the greatest extent possible, be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision.
