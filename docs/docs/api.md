# API

:::caution

Our API is still in alpha — things may change or break at any time!

If you have questions, come chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/eHQBNBqXuh). We’d love to hear about what you build!

:::


## General notes

Some APIs are not associated with any particular user. Other APIs require authentication.

APIs that require authentication accept an `Authorization` header in one of two formats:

- `Authorization: Key {key}`. A Manifold API key associated with a user
  account. Each account may have zero or one API keys. To generate an API key
  for your account, visit your user profile, click "edit", and click the
  "refresh" button next to the API key field at the bottom. You can click it
  again any time to invalidate your existing key and generate a new one.

- `Authorization: Bearer {jwt}`. A signed JWT from Firebase asserting your
  identity. This is what our web client uses. It will probably be annoying for
  you to generate and we will not document it further here.

API requests that accept parameters should either have the parameters in the
query string if they are GET requests, or have a body with a JSON object with
one property per parameter if they are POST requests.

API responses should always either have a body with a JSON result object (if
the response was a 200) or with a JSON object representing an error (if the
response was a 4xx or 5xx.)

## Usage Guidelines

Feel free to use the API for any purpose you'd like. We ask that you:
- Keep your bets to less than 10 per minute, amortized (transient spikes of over 10/min are okay).
- Keep your reads to less than 100 per second.

## Endpoints

### `GET /v0/user/[username]`

Gets a user by their username. Remember that usernames may change.

Requires no authorization.

### `GET /v0/user/by-id/[id]`

Gets a user by their unique ID. Many other API endpoints return this as the `userId`.

Requires no authorization.

### `GET /v0/me`

Returns the authenticated user.

### `GET /v0/groups`

Gets all groups, in no particular order.

Parameters:

- `availableToUserId`: Optional. if specified, only groups that the user can
  join and groups they've already joined will be returned.

Requires no authorization.

### `GET /v0/group/[slug]`

Gets a group by its slug.

Requires no authorization.
Note: group is singular in the URL.

### `GET /v0/group/by-id/[id]`

Gets a group by its unique ID.

Requires no authorization.
Note: group is singular in the URL.

### `GET /v0/group/by-id/[id]/markets`

Gets a group's markets by its unique ID.

Requires no authorization.
Note: group is singular in the URL.

### `GET /v0/markets`

Lists all markets, ordered by creation date descending.

Parameters:

- `limit`: Optional. How many markets to return. The maximum is 1000 and the default is 500.
- `before`: Optional. The ID of the market before which the list will start. For
  example, if you ask for the most recent 10 markets, and then perform a second
  query for 10 more markets with `before=[the id of the 10th market]`, you will
  get markets 11 through 20.

Requires no authorization.

### `GET /v0/users`

Parameters:

- `limit`: Optional. How many users to return. The maximum is 1000 and the default is 500.

  ```

### `POST /v0/bet`

Places a new bet on behalf of the authorized user.

Parameters:

- `amount`: Required. The amount to bet, in mana, before fees.
- `contractId`: Required. The ID of the contract (market) to bet on.
- `outcome`: Required. The outcome to bet on. For binary markets, this is `YES`
  or `NO`. For free response markets, this is the ID of the free response
  answer. For numeric markets, this is a string representing the target bucket,
  and an additional `value` parameter is required which is a number representing
  the target value. (Bet on numeric markets at your own peril.)
- `limitProb`: Optional. A number between `0.01` and `0.99` inclusive representing
  the limit probability for your bet (i.e. 1% to 99% — multiply by 100 for the
  probability percentage).
  The bet will execute immediately in the direction of `outcome`, but not beyond this
  specified limit. If not all the bet is filled, the bet will remain as an open offer
  that can later be matched against an opposite direction bet.
  - For example, if the current market probability is `50%`:
    - A `M$10` bet on `YES` with `limitProb=0.4` would not be filled until the market
      probability moves down to `40%` and someone bets `M$15` of `NO` to match your
      bet odds.
    - A `M$100` bet on `YES` with `limitProb=0.6` would fill partially or completely
      depending on current unfilled limit bets and the AMM's liquidity. Any remaining
      portion of the bet not filled would remain to be matched against in the future.
  - An unfilled limit order bet can be cancelled using the cancel API.
- `expiresAt`: Optional. A Unix timestamp (in milliseconds) at which the limit bet
  should be automatically canceled.

Example request:

```
$ curl https://manifold.markets/api/v0/bet -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Key {...}' \
    --data-raw '{"amount":1, \
                 "outcome":"YES", \
                 "contractId":"{...}"}'
```

Response type: A `Bet`.

### `POST /v0/bet/cancel/[id]`

Cancel the limit order of a bet with the specified id. If the bet was unfilled, it will be cancelled so that no other bets will match with it. This action is irreversible.

### `POST /v0/market`

Creates a new market on behalf of the authorized user.

Note: this costs mana. If you have insufficient mana, this call will return an error. The cost to create each type of market is:

| Market Type     | Creation Cost |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| BINARY          | M$50          |
| PSEUDO_NUMERIC  | M$250         |
| FREE_RESPONSE   | M$100         |
| MULTIPLE_CHOICE | M$100         |

Parameters:

- `outcomeType`: Required. One of `BINARY`, `FREE_RESPONSE`, `MULTIPLE_CHOICE`, or `PSEUDO_NUMERIC`.
- `question`: Required. The headline question for the market.
- `description`: Optional. A long description describing the rules for the market.
  - Note: string descriptions do **not** turn into links, mentions, formatted text. You may instead use `descriptionMarkdown` or `descriptionHtml` for rich text formatting.
- `closeTime`: Optional. The time at which the market will close, represented as milliseconds since the epoch. Defaults to 7 days from now.
- `visibility`: Optional. One of `public` (default) or `unlisted`. Controls whether the market can be shown on homepage and in search results.
- `groupId`: Optional. A group to create this market under.

For binary markets, you must also provide:

- `initialProb`: An initial probability for the market, between 1 and 99.

For numeric markets, you must also provide:

- `min`: The minimum value that the market may resolve to.
- `max`: The maximum value that the market may resolve to.
- `isLogScale`: If true, your numeric market will increase exponentially from min to max.
- `initialValue`: An initial value for the market, between min and max, exclusive.

For multiple choice markets, you must also provide:

- `answers`: An array of strings, each of which will be a valid answer for the market.

Example request:

```
$ curl https://manifold.markets/api/v0/market -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -H 'Authorization: Key {...}'
    --data-raw '{"outcomeType":"BINARY", \
                 "question":"Is there life on Mars?", \
                 "description":"I'm not going to type some long ass example description.", \
                 "closeTime":1700000000000, \

Parameters:

For binary markets:

For free response or multiple choice markets:
