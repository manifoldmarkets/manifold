# Bounties

## What are Manifold bounties?

From time to time, a member of our community goes above and beyond in helping Manifold make prediction markets accessible & ubiquitous. We‚Äôd like to recognize such contributions publicly, and include a token of our appreciation in the form of M$!

Examples of community work that may be eligible for a bounty:

- Blog posts, markets, or comments which lead us to significantly change our views
- A track record of creating markets that help people make better decisions
- Promoting Manifold & forecasting to a wider audience
- Identifying serious exploits with our financial infrastructure

Our community is the beating heart of Manifold; your individual contributions are what make this platform valuable at all. Thanks to everyone listed here (as well as countless unnamed others) for your help & support!
