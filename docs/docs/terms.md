**20. DISPUTE RESOLUTION**

**Informal Negotiations**

To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of Use (each "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the "Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other Party.

**Binding Arbitration**

If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL. The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, available at [www.jamsadr.com](https://www.jamsadr.com/). The arbitration may be conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing, but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except where otherwise required by the applicable JAMS rules or applicable law, the arbitration will take place in the United States, Delaware. Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.

If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the state and federal courts located in Delaware, and the Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts. Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.

In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) year after the cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.

**Small Claims Court Exception**

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either Party may bring an individual action in small claims court for Disputes within the jurisdiction of such court, provided the action remains in small claims court and is not removed or appealed to a court of general jurisdiction.

**Restrictions**

The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

**Fee Shifting for Frivolous Claims**

If the arbitrator determines that a claim or defense asserted by you was frivolous, brought in bad faith, or brought for the purpose of harassment, you agree to reimburse Manifold Markets, Inc. for all reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with the arbitration. A claim or defense is frivolous if it lacks any reasonable factual or legal basis.

**Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration**

The following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes brought by Manifold Markets, Inc. seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, and patents; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim by Manifold Markets, Inc. for injunctive or other equitable relief. For the avoidance of doubt, you agree that these exceptions apply only to claims brought by Manifold Markets, Inc., and you may not invoke these exceptions to pursue claims against us in court.
