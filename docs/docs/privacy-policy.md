# Manifold Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 31st, 2026**

## 1. Introduction

Manifold Markets, Inc ("**Manifold**" or "**we**", "**our**", or "**us**") is a social media platform that lets people discuss the future and trade on **play‑money prediction markets**. Because we ask users to share ideas, forecasts, and data, protecting your privacy is core to our mission. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, the choices you have, and the rights you can exercise.

By using Manifold—whether through our website, mobile apps, or any other services we provide (collectively, the "**Services**")—you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use our Services.

## 2. Scope

This Privacy Policy applies to personal information processed in connection with the Services. It does **not** apply to third‑party websites or services that we do not control, even if they link to, or are accessible from, Manifold.

---

## 3. Information We Collect

### 3.1 Information You Provide to Us

- **Account details** – display name, username, email address, password, and, if you choose, a profile picture or avatar.
- **Content** – posts, comments, predictions, market questions, signals, messages, and any other content you upload or create.
- **Play‑money balances & transactions** – the virtual currency ("Mana"), trade orders, positions, and settlement outcomes.
- **Communication with us** – requests, feedback, survey responses, and any correspondence with customer support.

### 3.2 Information We Collect Automatically

- **Usage & log data** – time spent, markets visited, search queries, and interactions with content or ads.
- **Device & connection data** – IP address, browser type, operating system, device identifiers, and crash reports.
- **Cookies & similar tech** – small files or SDK data used to recognize you and to improve and secure the Services (see Section 8).

### 3.3 Payment Information

When you purchase Mana or make other payments through our Services, your payment is processed by **Stripe, Inc.** We do not store your full credit card number or payment credentials on our servers. Stripe collects and processes your payment information in accordance with their privacy policy ([stripe.com/privacy](https://stripe.com/privacy)). We receive from Stripe only limited information such as the last four digits of your card, card type, billing address, and transaction confirmations.

### 3.4 Identity Verification Information (KYC/AML)

To comply with applicable Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations, and to prevent fraud, we may require identity verification for certain activities (such as claiming prizes from sweepstakes drawings, high-value transactions, or as otherwise required by law). When identity verification is required, we use third-party identity verification providers, including **Idenfy** ([idenfy.com/privacy-policy](https://www.idenfy.com/privacy-policy/)), to collect and process:

- **Government-issued identity documents** – images or scans of passports, driver's licenses, national ID cards, or other official identification documents.
- **Biometric data** – photographs or selfies used for facial recognition and liveness detection to match your face against your identity document.
- **Verification metadata** – document authenticity checks, fraud signals, verification status, and risk scores.

Identity verification data is processed by our third-party providers on our behalf. We receive verification results (pass/fail status, risk scores, and flags) and may retain copies of identity documents as required for compliance purposes. Our identity verification providers process your data in accordance with their own privacy policies and applicable data protection laws.

**Important:** Biometric data collected for identity verification is used solely for the purpose of verifying your identity and is not used for any other purpose, including advertising or profiling.

### 3.5 API Usage Data

If you access our Services through our public API, we collect information about your API usage, including: API key identifiers, request timestamps, endpoints accessed, IP addresses, request/response metadata, and rate limit data. This information is used to enforce rate limits, detect abuse, and improve our API services.

### 3.6 Information from Third Parties

We may receive information about you from:

- **Social sign‑in providers** (if you link or create your account using an external service);
- **Analytics & advertising partners** that help us understand usage or measure performance.

## 4. How We Use Information

We process your information to:

1. **Provide and maintain the Services** – create accounts, display markets, execute trades, process play‑money settlements.
2. **Personalize your experience** – recommend markets, forecasts, and people to follow.
3. **Enable social features** – show your public username, predictions, and comments to other users.
4. **Research & improve** – analyze behavior, test new features, and build aggregate statistics (e.g., market accuracy).
5. **Internal machine learning** – we may use aggregated and anonymized data to train internal models that improve our Services, such as market recommendations, spam detection, and forecasting accuracy analysis. We do not use your personal information to train general-purpose AI models for external licensing or sale.
6. **Communicate with you** – send transactional notices (e.g., market resolutions, account activity), security alerts, and service-related updates. We may also send periodic newsletters and market/portfolio updates that we believe are relevant to your use of the Services. You can opt out of non-essential communications at any time (see Section 7).
7. **Ensure safety & integrity** – detect and prevent fraud, spam, abusive content, and violations of our Terms.
8. **Identity verification & compliance** – verify your identity for KYC/AML purposes, prevent fraud, and comply with financial regulations when you engage in activities that require verification (such as claiming prizes from sweepstakes drawings).
9. **Comply with legal obligations** – respond to lawful requests and enforce our agreements.

## 5. Legal Bases for Processing (EEA/UK only)

If you are in the European Economic Area or United Kingdom, we process your personal data on one or more of the following bases:

- **Contract** – as necessary to provide the Services you request (Article 6(1)(b) GDPR).
- **Legitimate interests** – to keep our Services safe, improve them, communicate with you about features and updates relevant to your account activity, and grow our business, provided those interests are not overridden by your rights (Article 6(1)(f)). You may object to processing based on legitimate interests at any time.
- **Consent** – for optional uses such as certain cookies or special categories of data (Article 6(1)(a)). You may withdraw consent at any time; however, withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing conducted prior to withdrawal, nor does it affect processing of your data conducted in reliance on other lawful bases.
- **Legal obligation** – where processing is necessary to comply with applicable law (Article 6(1)(c)).

**Special Category Data (Biometric Data):** When we collect biometric data for identity verification purposes, we process this data based on your explicit consent (Article 9(2)(a) GDPR) or where processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest related to preventing fraud and money laundering (Article 9(2)(g) GDPR), as implemented under applicable member state law. You will be asked to provide explicit consent before submitting biometric data for identity verification.

## 6. How We Share Information

We may share information:

- **Publicly** – your username, avatar, predictions, market comments, and trades are visible to anyone unless you use a feature we label as private (e.g., direct messages).
- **Service providers & contractors** – companies that host data, send emails, provide analytics or security, and help us operate (bound by confidentiality and data‑protection obligations). This includes identity verification providers such as **Idenfy**, who process identity documents and biometric data on our behalf for KYC/AML compliance.
- **Advertising & marketing partners** – only if we decide to show ads; partners will not receive your private messages or password.
- **Compliance & safety** – to comply with laws, respond to legal process, protect our users, or defend our rights.
- **Business transfers** – in connection with a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, or sale of assets; we will notify you of changes.
- **Public data licensing** – content you choose to make public on the Site—including your username, public trades, market creations, and comments—may be licensed or sold to third parties as part of data products or research datasets. This reflects the public nature of prediction markets and your agreement under our Terms of Service to grant us rights to distribute your public Contributions.

We do **not** sell your private personal information (such as your email address, payment details, private messages, or non-public account data) for money.

## 7. Your Choices & Rights

- **Access & portability** – request a copy of your data.
- **Correction** – update or correct inaccurate information.
- **Deletion** – delete your account or ask us to erase certain data.
- **Limit or object** – restrict processing under certain circumstances, including objecting to marketing communications.
- **Opt out of marketing** – you can unsubscribe from non-essential emails at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email, or by adjusting your notification preferences in Settings. We will honor your request promptly.
- **Do Not Track** – we do not respond to browser DNT signals at this time.

## 8. Cookies & Similar Technologies

We use cookies, local storage, and mobile SDKs to:

- Keep you logged in;
- Remember preferences;
- Measure site performance;
- Fight fraud and abuse.

You can control cookies through your browser settings and mobile OS permissions; disabling certain cookies may limit functionality.

## 9. Data Retention

We keep your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described in this Policy, maintain our Services, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, and protect our legitimate business interests. Retention periods vary based on the type of data and how it is used.

After account deletion, we will erase or anonymize most personal data within a reasonable timeframe (typically 30–90 days), except where retention is necessary for: (a) compliance with legal, regulatory, or audit obligations; (b) fraud prevention and security purposes; (c) resolving disputes or enforcing our Terms; (d) completing transactions initiated before deletion; (e) backup and disaster recovery systems (which are purged on a rolling basis); or (f) other legitimate business purposes.

**Identity Verification Data.** Identity documents, biometric data, and verification records collected for KYC/AML purposes are retained for as long as required by applicable financial regulations and anti-money laundering laws (typically 5–7 years after the end of the customer relationship or last transaction, depending on jurisdiction). Biometric data used solely for identity matching is deleted after verification is complete, unless retention is required by law.

**Aggregated and Anonymized Data.** Once data has been aggregated or anonymized such that it can no longer reasonably identify you, it is no longer considered personal data. We may retain, use, and disclose such data indefinitely for any lawful purpose, including analytics, research, product improvement, and commercial licensing, without restriction.

## 10. Security

We implement administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information, including encryption in transit, access controls, and regular security audits. No system is 100% secure; we encourage you to use strong passwords and enable two‑factor authentication.

---

## 11. International Data Transfers

Manifold is headquartered in the United States. When you use our Services, your information may be processed in, and transferred to, countries outside of your own that may not offer the same level of data protection. We rely on Standard Contractual Clauses or other legal mechanisms to safeguard EU/UK data transfers.

---

## 12. Children's Privacy

Manifold is not directed to children under 13 (or the minimum age required by local law). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we learn a child has provided personal data, we will delete it.

## 13. California Privacy Rights (CCPA/CPRA)

If you are a California resident, you have specific rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA):

### Your Rights

- **Right to Know** – You may request information about the categories and specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you, the sources of that information, our business purposes for collecting it, and the categories of third parties with whom we share it.
- **Right to Delete** – You may request that we delete personal information we have collected from you. However, we may retain information where permitted or required by law, including for: compliance with legal obligations; fraud detection and prevention; security and abuse prevention; completing transactions; exercising or defending legal claims; debugging and error repair; enabling solely internal uses aligned with your expectations; and other purposes permitted under CCPA/CPRA.
- **Right to Correct** – You may request that we correct inaccurate personal information we maintain about you.
- **Right to Opt-Out of Sale/Sharing** – You have the right to opt out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information. We do not sell your private personal information (email, payment details, private messages) for monetary consideration. However, public content you post—including your username, trades, and comments—may be included in licensed data products, as this information is already publicly visible and you have granted us distribution rights under our Terms of Service. We may also share certain information with advertising partners for targeted advertising purposes. To opt out of advertising-related sharing, email [privacy@manifold.markets](mailto:privacy@manifold.markets) with the subject line "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information."
- **Right to Limit Use of Sensitive Personal Information** – We collect certain sensitive personal information, including government-issued identification numbers and biometric data, solely for identity verification and KYC/AML compliance purposes. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal information for purposes other than those permitted under CPRA, such as verifying your identity, preventing fraud, and complying with legal obligations. You may request that we limit the use of your sensitive personal information to these necessary purposes.
- **Right to Non-Discrimination** – We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your privacy rights.

### Categories of Personal Information Collected

In the preceding 12 months, we have collected the following categories of personal information: identifiers (name, email, IP address, government ID numbers); biometric information (facial images for identity verification); commercial information (Mana purchase history); internet or network activity (usage data, API logs); sensitive personal information (government identification and biometric data for KYC/AML purposes); and inferences drawn from the above.

### How to Exercise Your Rights

To submit a request, email [privacy@manifold.markets](mailto:privacy@manifold.markets) or visit Settings → Privacy Controls. We will verify your identity before processing your request. You may designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf.

We will respond to verifiable requests within 45 days of receipt. If we require additional time (up to an additional 45 days) due to the complexity or volume of requests, we will notify you of the extension and the reason for it.
