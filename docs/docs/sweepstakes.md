### How do sweepstakes markets differ from the play-money markets on Manifold?

All markets on Manifold are by default play-money and use our play-money called mana. Selected markets will have a second sweepstakes version created which will use sweepcash. This will share the same page, question, description and comments as the original play-money market, but will have seperate entries (trades) and prizes using Sweepcash. Users may switch back and forth between the two markets using the tab found on the market page.

### How do I enter a sweepstakes market?

Users may participate in a sweepstakes market by using sweepcash. It is free to enter and users can receive Manicash by:

- Verifying their phone number and personal details for a welcome gift.
- Completing their daily streak for a free bonus.
- As a free gift with some purchases.

### How do I withdraw my Sweepcash winnings?

Only sweepcash won from a market resolution can be withdrawn. Sweepcash received from gifts, bonuses, or exiting a market early can not be withdrawn and you must use it to win a resolved market first. Visit your withdrawals dashboard to view how much sweepcash you have won and can withdraw. Then, fill out your bank details and request the amount of sweepcash you wish to redeem for real-money. There is a $25.00 minimum withdrawal.

### Withdrawal processing time

Please expect to wait 5-7 business days after withdrawal as we process it.

### Can I cash out my mana winnings or turn mana to Sweepcash?

No, mana is purely a play-money and not exchangeable for sweepcash, money, or any other goods and items.

### Do I need to pay taxes on my winnings?

Manifold cannot provide tax advice to customers. Please consult with your state's tax laws and consult with a lawyer.

Users who cash out more than $600 may be issued a 1099 form showing their total winnings.

### How can I get one of my markets to be made in sweepstakes?

The Manifold staff may elect, in its sole discretion, to transform any user-created question to have both a mana and sweepcash market. Creators will continue to manage the market and resolve the mana market, however Manifold will resolve the sweepstakes market.

To increase the chances of having your market selected for sweepstakes:

- It should be a binary market
- It should have clear, unambiguous criteria
- It should be actively managed
- It should be interesting to a broad audience
- Markets created by a user with a strong track record of creating and managing markets well will be prioritised.
- Markets with shorter resolution dates will be prioritised

### What happens if I think a sweepstakes market has been resolved incorrectly?

Only Manifold staff may resolve a sweepstakes market. Staff will adhere to the resolution criteria outlined in the description. When a market is selected to add sweepstakes functionality, Manifold may work with the creator and traders to ensure robust, unambiguous resolution criteria. Manifold, in its sole discretion, will determine sweepstakes market settlement.

If you believe a sweepstakes market has been incorrectly resolved, please email info@manifold.markets

### Do sweepstake markets contribute towards leagues?

No, for the time-being we are sticking with mana and play money markets for leagues. Leagues will continue to award mana to users who perform the best on our play money markets.
