### How do I enter a sweepstakes market?
Users may participate in a sweepstakes market by using Manicash. It is free to enter and users can receive Manicash by:
- Verifying their phone number and personal details for a welcome gift.
- Achieving their daily streak.
- Posting a letter to Manifold Sweepstakes Inc.
- As a free gift when purchasing mana.


### How do I cash out my Sweepcash to real-money?
Sweepcash won from a market resolving can be redeemed for a real-money payout. Simply go to your withdrawals dashboard and fill out your bank details and request the amount of Sweepcash you wish to redeem for real-money.

Sweepcash won by exiting a market early (eg. by selling shares) will not be eligible to be redeemed. You must use sweepcash to enter a sweepstakes market and wait for it to resolve in your favor to be able to redeem them. You may view how much sweepcash you are eligible to withdraw on your withdrawals dashboard.

### Do I need to pay taxes on my winnings?
Users do not have to pay taxes on any Sweepcash won.
U.S. customers will need to pay taxes on any money that has been cashed out from that Sweepcash.

Customers from other countries should consult their countries' tax laws.

### How can I get one of my markets to be made in sweepstakes?

The Manifold staff may choose any user-created market to have sweepstakes. Manifold will fund the initial subsidisation of the sweepstakes market. Creators will continue to manage the market and resolve the play-money market, however Manifold will resolve the sweepstakes market.

To increase the chances of having your market selected for sweepstakes:
- It should be a binary market
- It should have clear, unambiguous criteria
- It should be actively managed
- It should be interesting to a broad audience
- Markets created by a user with a strong track record of creating and managing markets well will be prioritised.
- Markets with shorter resolution dates will be prioritised

### What happens if I think a sweepstakes market has been resolved incorrectly?

Only Manifold staff will resolve a sweepstakes market. When a market is selected to have sweepstakes, we will work with the creator and traders to ensure robust, unambiguous criteria. Inevitably, there will be situations where unexpected events occurs leading to mixed interpretation on how the market should be resolved. In these situations Manifold will make an ultimate decision but will take in as much community feedback as possible to remain unbiased.

If you believe a sweepstakes market has been incorrectly resolved, please email info@manifold.markets
