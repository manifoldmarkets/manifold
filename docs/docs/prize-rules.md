## 12. DISPUTES, GOVERNING LAW, AND ARBITRATION

### 12.1 Governing Law

These Official Rules and any disputes arising out of or relating to any Prize Drawing shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, United States, without regard to its conflict of laws principles.

### 12.2 Informal Resolution

Before initiating any formal dispute resolution proceeding, entrant agrees to first contact Sponsor at legal@manifold.markets to attempt to resolve any dispute informally. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith for at least thirty (30) days before initiating arbitration.

### 12.3 Binding Arbitration

**PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO FILE A LAWSUIT IN COURT.**

Except as otherwise provided herein, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Official Rules, any Prize Drawing, or any prize (collectively, "Disputes") shall be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS pursuant to its Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures and in accordance with the Expedited Procedures in those Rules (the "JAMS Rules"), as modified by this Section.

### 12.4 Arbitration Procedures

- (a) **Arbitrator Selection:** The arbitration shall be conducted by a single neutral arbitrator selected in accordance with the JAMS Rules.

- (b) **Location:** The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California, unless the parties mutually agree otherwise or the arbitrator determines that such location would impose an undue burden on the entrant, in which case the arbitration may be conducted by telephone, videoconference, or written submissions.

- (c) **Language:** The arbitration shall be conducted in English.

- (d) **Confidentiality:** The arbitration proceedings and any award shall be confidential, except as necessary to enforce the award or as required by law.

- (e) **Arbitrator Authority:** The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve all Disputes, including the scope, applicability, and enforceability of this arbitration agreement. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any remedy that would be available in court, except as limited by these Official Rules.

- (f) **Fees and Costs:** Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees, and the parties shall share equally the fees and costs of the arbitrator and JAMS, except: (i) Sponsor will pay all arbitration fees and costs that entrant would not be required to pay if the dispute were litigated in court; and (ii) if the arbitrator finds that either party's claim or defense was frivolous, brought in bad faith, or asserted for an improper purpose (such as to harass, cause unnecessary delay, or needlessly increase the cost of dispute resolution), the arbitrator may award the prevailing party its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred as a result of such conduct.

- (g) **Award:** The arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

### 12.5 Class Action Waiver

**TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ENTRANT AGREES THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.**

If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, both entrant and Sponsor waive any right to a jury trial. Entrant and Sponsor agree that each may bring claims against the other only in an individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding.

### 12.6 Exceptions to Arbitration

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the following claims are not subject to arbitration:

- (a) Claims seeking injunctive or other equitable relief in aid of arbitration;
- (b) Claims within the jurisdiction of a small claims court; and
- (c) Claims by Sponsor for intellectual property infringement, fraud, or violation of these Official Rules.

### 12.7 Severability of Arbitration Provisions

If any portion of this Section 12 is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portions shall remain in full force and effect. If the class action waiver in Section 12.5 is found to be unenforceable as to a particular claim, then that claim (and only that claim) shall be severed from arbitration and may proceed in court, while all other claims shall be resolved in arbitration.
