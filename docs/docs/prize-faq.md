# Manifold Prize Drawing FAQ

## What is this?

Manifold runs periodic prize drawings where you can win real money (paid in USDC) just by being an active predictor on the platform. No purchase necessary.

---

## How do I enter?

**Option 1: Be an active predictor**

If you're actively using Manifold to predict on markets, you'll automatically earn entries based on the mana you accumulate. More activity = more entries.

**Option 2: Free entry**

Don't want to predict? You can still enter for free at [manifold.markets/prize](https://manifold.markets/prize). Everyone gets a fair shot.

---

## What are the requirements to enter?

- **Age:** You must be 18 or older
- **Active predictor:** You need at least **1,000 mana invested across markets** to enter. This ensures the prize drawing is for people actually using the platform, not just drive-by entries.
- **One account per person:** Only your main account can enter. If you have bot accounts or alts, send that mana to your main account — those other accounts can't enter separately.
- **Not in a restricted location:** See below.

---

## Where can't I enter from?

Sorry, but we can't offer prize drawings in these places:

**US States:**

- Delaware, Idaho, Michigan, Nevada, New York, Washington, and Washington D.C.

**Canada:**

- Ontario

**Countries:**

- Australia, Belarus, Burundi, Central African Republic, Cuba, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Germany, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Libya, Myanmar, Netherlands, Nicaragua, North Korea, Russia, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela, Yemen, Zimbabwe

If you're in one of these places, you can still use Manifold — you just can't participate in prize drawings.

---

## How are winners picked?

Winners are selected through a fair, tamper-proof algorithmic process. Every eligible entry has an equal chance of winning. More entries = better odds, but it's still random.

---

## What do I win?

Prizes are paid in **USDC** (a stablecoin pegged to the US dollar). The specific prize amounts and number of winners vary — check [manifold.markets/prize](https://manifold.markets/prize) for current drawings.

---

## How do I get my prize?

1. We'll notify you in the app if you win
2. You have **5 days** to give us a crypto wallet address that can receive USDC
3. We send you the USDC

That's it. If you don't respond within 5 days, you forfeit the prize.

---

## Do I have to pay taxes?

Yes, prizes are taxable income, but we're not tax advisors and cannot offer advice. Please talk to a tax professional if you have questions.

---

## Can I enter with multiple accounts?

**No.** One account per person, period.

If you have alt accounts or bot accounts, that's fine — but send the mana to your main account if you want it to count toward entries. Entering with multiple accounts will get you disqualified (and possibly banned).

---

## What else can get me disqualified?

- Bonus harvesting or gaming the entry system
- Using bots/scripts to enter
- Faking your location with a VPN
- Providing false information
- Misresolving markets
- Generally being sketchy

We reserve the right to disqualify anyone for any reason. Don't try to game the system.

---

## Will there always be prize drawings?

We intend to keep running prize drawings and will share as much information as we can about our plans for future drawings. That said, we can't make guarantees — we may need to pause, modify, or discontinue drawings at any time, including ones we've already announced.

---


## Will Manifold admins ever ask for the private key to my crypto wallet?

**Never.** We will never ask for your private key, seed phrase, or recovery phrase. Anyone who does is a scammer — please report them to us immediately.

---

## Is there a Manifold token?

**No.** Manifold has not issued any cryptocurrency token. If someone is promoting a "Manifold token" or asking you to buy/trade one, it's a scam.

## Where are the full legal terms?
