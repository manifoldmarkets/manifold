                <ExpandSection title="What is a prediction market?">
                  Prediction markets are platforms where people bet on the
                  likelihood of future events, and the probabilities reflect the
                  crowd's collective predictions. Participants have a financial
                  incentive to make accurate predictions, encouraging a dynamic
                  exchange of information. This makes prediction markets
                  effective tools for forecasting and decision-making. Overall,
                  prediction markets are valuable because they harness
                  collective wisdom, incentivize accurate predictions, and
                  provide dynamic insights into the likelihood of future events.

                <ExpandSection title="How accurate are prediction markets?">
                  Manifold's markets stand apart from resources like CollegeVine
                  or college admission subreddits with their demonstrated
                  accuracy in predicting probabilities. The provided calibration
                  chart evaluates how closely the actual outcomes match
                  Manifold's predictions. Ideally, the blue dots on the chart
                  should align with the diagonal line, indicating precise
                  calibration. For instance, a dot representing a 70% predicted
                  probability indicates that out of similar forecasts, 70%
                  indeed resolved positively, verifying the prediction's
                  accuracy. Overall, Manifold is a well calibrated platform,
                  which means that the probability you have for admissions at a
                  given college should be fairly accurate.

                <ExpandSection title="Should I make an account if I'm not in 12th grade yet?">
                  Absolutely! Prediction markets are dynamic systems that
                  respond to new information. If you were to create one for
                  college admissions before reaching 12th grade, it would still
                  work well. These markets continuously update as you progress
                  through your academic journey, considering your achievements
                  and experiences. People participating in the market anticipate
                  that your profile will evolve over time, and they make
                  informed guesses based on your current accomplishments and
                  future potential. While your age may be a factor, prediction
                  markets are designed to effectively evaluate possibilities for
                  individuals at different stages of their education.

                  Here is an example of an admissions profile for a hypothetical

                <ExpandSection title="Will my information be private?">
                  Other users will be able to see your admissions profile and
                  bet on it, as this is a key mechanism of the website. However,
                  you are able to be anonymous and your name will not be shared
                  with any colleges or universities. You are also welcome to
                  provide as little or as much information as you like when you
                  create your profile, although you will get more accurate
                  probabilities the more information you give. Feel free to
                  check out the privacy policy and terms and conditions on the
