            When you {TRADE_TERM} on long-term markets, your funds (mana) are
            tied up until the outcome is determined, which could take years. To
            let you continue to place {TRADE_TERM}s, we offer a unique solution:
            0% interest loans. Each day, you're eligible to receive a loan
            amounting to {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 100}% of your total {TRADE_TERM}{' '}
            value. If the value of your {TRADE_TERM} decreases, the loan amount
            will be {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 100}% of the current, lower value.

          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Yes, but don't worry! You will automatically pay back loans when the
            question resolves or you sell your {TRADE_TERM}.

          </span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Loans make it worthwhile to {TRADE_TERM} on questions that won't
            resolve for months or years, because your investment won't be locked
            up as long.

          <span className={'text-primary-700'}>• What is an example?</span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            For example, if you {TRADE_TERM} {ENV_CONFIG.moneyMoniker}1000 on
            "Will I become a millionaire?", you will get{' '}
            {ENV_CONFIG.moneyMoniker}
            {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 1000} back tomorrow.
          </span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Previous loans count against your total invested amount. So on the
            next day, you would get back {LOAN_DAILY_RATE * 100}% of{' '}
