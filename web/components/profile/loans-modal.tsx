            ‚Ä¢ Do I have to pay back a loan?
          </span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Yes, don't worry! You will automatically pay back loans when the
            market resolves or you sell your bet.
          </span>
          <span className={'text-indigo-700'}>
            ‚Ä¢ What is the purpose of loans?
          </span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Loans make it worthwhile to bet on markets that won't resolve for
            months or years, because your investment won't be locked up as long.
          </span>
          <span className={'text-indigo-700'}>‚Ä¢ What is an example?</span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            For example, if you bet M$1000 on "Will I become a millionare?" on
            Monday, you will get M$10 back on Tuesday.
          </span>
          <span className={'ml-2'}>
            Previous loans count against your total bet amount. So on Wednesday,
            you would get back 1% of M$990 = M$9.9.
