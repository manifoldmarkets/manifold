      As the market prices moves further from the true probability, the odd's

      money to be made once the market resolves.

        A Manipulator Can Aid Prediction Market Accuracy
      </a>
      . In it he examines how both historical and lab data fail to find
      substantial effects of manipulation on average price accuracy.
      Furthermore, he finds in his model that adding a manipulator may even
      increase accuracy as it increases noise trading which tends to have a
      positive effect in low liquidity markets.
