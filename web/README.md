# Manifold Markets web app

## Getting started

To run the development server, install [Yarn 1.x][yarn], and then in this directory:

1. `yarn` to install all dependencies
2. `yarn dev:dev` starts a development web server, pointing at the development database
3. Your site will be available on http://localhost:3000

Check package.json for other command-line tasks. (e.g. `yarn dev` will point the development server at the prod
database. `yarn emulate` will run against a local emulated database, if you are serving it via `yarn serve` from the
[`functions/` package][functions-readme].)

## Tech stack

Manifold's website uses [Next.js][nextjs], which is a [React][react]-based framework that handles concerns like routing,
builds, and a development server. It's also integrated with [Vercel][vercel], which is responsible for hosting the site
and providing some other production functionality like serving the API. The application code is written exclusively in
Typescript. Styling is done via CSS-in-JS in the React code and uses [Tailwind][tailwind] CSS classes.

## Building and deployment

Vercel's GitHub integration monitors the repository and automatically builds (`next build`) and deploys both the `main`
branch (to production) and PR branches (to ephemeral staging servers that can be used for testing.)

Parts of the file structure that directly map to HTTP endpoints are organized specially per Next.js's prescriptions:

### public/

These are static files that will be [served by Next verbatim][next-static-files].

### pages/

These are components that [Next's router][next-pages] is aware of and interprets as page roots per their filename,
e.g. the React component in pages/portfolio.tsx is rendered on the user portfolio page at /portfolio. You should
look in here or in `components/` to find any specific piece of UI you are interested in working on.

### pages/api/

Modules under this route are specially interpreted by Next/Vercel as [functions that will be hosted by
Vercel][vercel-functions]. This is where the public Manifold HTTP API lives.
