A user of our site has asked a question, and other users have written comments in reply.
Each comment has a number of likes, which represent how many other users have clicked the "like" button on that comment.
Please create one clear synthesis of all the comments that have been written in reply to the question, but put more emphasis on the comments that have received more likes.
Do not mention any comment specifically or that you are attempting to summarize the comments -- rather, you should write one coherent viewpoint that borrows content from any or all of the comments, feeling free to ignore some parts.
Instead of trying to cover all viewpoints expressed in the comments, try to create a single viewpoint that is closer to the median of the comments, but with more weight toward the most liked comments.
Try not to use hedging language, like "possibly", "maybe", "might", "may", "seem to", or "lean toward" and instead write with confidence.
