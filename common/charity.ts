    description: `1Day Sooner is a non-profit that advocates on behalf of COVID-19 challenge trial volunteers.
      
    After a vaccine candidate is created in a lab, it is developed through a combination of pre-clinical evaluation and three phases of clinical trials that test its safety and efficacy. In traditional Phase III trials, participants receive the vaccine candidate or a placebo/active comparator, and efficacy is judged by comparing the prevalence of infection in the vaccine group and the placebo/comparator group, to test the hypothesis that significantly fewer participants in the vaccine group get infected. In these traditional trials, after receiving the treatment, participants return to their homes and their normal daily lives so as to test the treatment under real world conditions. Since only a small proportion of these participants may encounter the disease, it may take a large number of participants and a good deal of time for these trials to reveal differences between the vaccine and placebo groups.
      
    In a human challenge trial (HCT), willing participants would receive the vaccine candidate or placebo and, after some time for the vaccine to take effect, be deliberately exposed to live coronavirus. Since exposure to the virus is guaranteed in HCTs, it may be possible to judge a vaccine candidate’s efficacy more quickly and with far fewer participants than a standard Phase III trial. While HCT efficacy results do not traditionally provide sufficient basis for licensure on their own, they could allow us to (1) more quickly weed out disappointing vaccine candidates or (2) promote the development of promising candidates in conjunction with traditional Phase III studies.
      
    In addition, by gathering detailed data on the process of infection and vaccine protection in a clinical setting, researchers could learn information that proves extremely useful for broader vaccine and therapeutic development efforts. Altogether, there are scenarios in which the speed of HCTs and the richness of the data they provide accelerate the development of an effective and broadly accessible COVID-19 vaccine, with thousands of lives spared (depending on the pandemic’s long-term trajectory).`,

    GiveWell is a nonprofit dedicated to finding outstanding giving opportunities and publishing the full details of our analysis to help donors decide where to give.
    
    We don't focus solely on financials, such as assessing administrative or fundraising costs. Instead, we conduct in-depth research to determine how much good a given program accomplishes (in terms of lives saved, lives improved, etc.) per dollar spent. Rather than rating as many charities as possible, we focus on the few charities that stand out most (by our criteria) in order to find and confidently recommend high-impact giving opportunities (our list of top charities).
    
    Our top recommendation to GiveWell donors seeking to do the most good possible is to donate to the Maximum Impact Fund. Donations to the Maximum Impact Fund are granted each quarter. We use our latest research to grant the funds to the recommended charity (or charities) where we believe they’ll do the most good.
    
    We grant funds from the Maximum Impact Fund to the recipient charity (or charities) at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our research team decides which charities have the highest priority funding needs at that time. This decision takes into consideration factors such as:

    - Which funding gaps we expect to be filled and unfilled
    - Each charity’s plans for additional funding
    - The cost-effectiveness of each funding gap`,

    description: `ARC is a non-profit research organization whose mission is to align future machine learning systems with human interests. Its current work focuses on developing an alignment strategy that could be adopted in industry today while scaling gracefully to future ML systems. Right now Paul Christiano and Mark Xu are researchers and Kyle Scott handles operations.

What is “alignment”? ML systems can exhibit goal-directed behavior, but it is difficult to understand or control what they are “trying” to do. Powerful models could cause harm if they were trying to manipulate and deceive humans. The goal of intent alignment is to instead train these models to be helpful and honest.

Motivation: We believe that modern ML techniques would lead to severe misalignment if scaled up to large enough computers and datasets. Practitioners may be able to adapt before these failures have catastrophic consequences, but we could reduce the risk by adopting scalable methods further in advance.

What we’re working on: The best way to understand our research priorities and methodology is probably to read our report on Eliciting Latent Knowledge. At a high level, we’re trying to figure out how to train ML systems to answer questions by straightforwardly “translating” their beliefs into natural language rather than by reasoning about what a human wants to hear.

Methodology: We’re unsatisfied with an algorithm if we can see any plausible story about how it eventually breaks down, which means that we can rule out most algorithms on paper without ever implementing them. The cost of this approach is that it may completely miss strategies that exploit important structure in realistic ML models; the benefit is that you can consider lots of ideas quickly. (More)

Future plans: We expect to focus on similar theoretical problems in alignment until we either become more pessimistic about tractability or ARC grows enough to branch out into other areas. Over the long term we are likely to work on a combination of theoretical and empirical alignment research, collaborations with industry labs, alignment forecasting, and ML deployment policy.`,

      'Support and fund research on how ideology and government policy contribute to scientific, technological, and social progress.',
    description: `Over the last few decades, scientific and technological progress have stagnated. Scientists conduct more research than ever before, but groundbreaking innovation is scarce. At the same time, identity politics and political polarization have reached new extremes, and social trends such as family stability and crime are worse than in previous decades and in some cases moving in the wrong direction. What explains these trends, and how can we reverse them?

    Much of the blame lies with the institutions we rely on for administration, innovation, and leadership. Instead of forward-looking governments, we have short-sighted politicians and bloated bureaucracies. Instead of real experts with proven track records, we have so-called ‘experts’ who appeal to the authority of their credentials. Instead of political leaders willing to face facts and make tough tradeoffs, we have politicians who appeal to ignorance and defer responsibility.
    
    To fix our institutions, we need to rethink them from the ground up. That is why CSPI supports and funds research into the administrative systems, organizational structures, and political ideologies of modern governance. Only by understanding what makes these systems so often dysfunctional can we change them for the better.
    
    CSPI believes that governments should be accountable to the populace as a whole, not special interest groups. We think experts should have greater say in public policy, but that there should be different standards for what qualifies as “expertise.” We want to end scientific and technological stagnation and usher in a new era of growth and innovation.
    
    We are interested in funding and supporting research that can speak to these issues in the social sciences through grants and fellowships. CSPI particularly seek outs work that is unlikely to receive support elsewhere. See our home page for more about the kinds of research we are particularly interested in funding.`,

      'ProPublica is an independent, nonprofit newsroom that produces investigative journalism with moral force. We dig deep into important issues, shining a light on abuses of power and betrayals of public trust — and we stick with those issues as long as it takes to hold power to account. With a team of more than 100 dedicated journalists, ProPublica covers a range of topics including government and politics, business, criminal justice, the environment, education, health care, immigration, and technology. We focus on stories with the potential to spur real-world impact. Among other positive changes, our reporting has contributed to the passage of new laws; reversals of harmful policies and practices; and accountability for leaders at local, state and national levels.',

      "Our pioneering programs address children's unique needs, giving them a healthy start in life, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. In the United States and around the world, our work creates lasting change for children, their families and communities – ultimately, transforming the future we all share.\nThis work is only made possible by the ongoing generosity of our donors, whose valuable support is used in the most cost-effective ways. It's important to note that all our work intersects – helping a boy or girl go to school also protects them from dangers such as child trafficking and early marriage. Keeping children healthy from disease or malnutrition means their parents are more likely to avoid costly treatment and be better able to provide for their family.\nWe don’t go into communities, carry out a project and then move on. We consult with children, their families, community leaders and local councils to understand all the issues or barriers, and then we develop programs that address these. We build trust so that our programs are successful and bring about real change.",
