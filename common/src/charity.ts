To achieve this, Balsa Research specializes in identifying not only potential changes but also the most pertinent questions to ask regarding current problems and the impact of proposed changes. The organization then commissions credible academic work to discover and quantify the answers to these questions, emphasizing the impact on relevant constituencies and stakeholders whenever possible. Balsa Research aims to eventually expand its approach to encompass a full stack of policy advocacy activities.`,

    Longtermism is held back by two bottlenecks:
    1. Lots of funding, but few charities to deploy it.
    2. Lots of talent, but few charities creating jobs.

    Solution: Longtermism needs more charities to deploy funding and create jobs. Our goal is to 10x the number of talented people working on longtermism by launching dozens of high impact charities.

    This helps solve the bottlenecks because entrepreneurs “unlock” latent EA talent - if one person starts an organization that employs 100 people who weren’t previously working on AI safety, that doubles the number of people working on the problem.

    Our process:
    1. Research the highest leverage ideas
    2. Find the right founders
    3. Connect them with mentors and funding

    description: `ARC is a non-profit research organization whose mission is to align future machine learning systems with human interests. Its current work focuses on developing an alignment strategy that could be adopted in industry today while scaling gracefully to future ML systems. Right now Paul Christiano and Mark Xu are researchers and Kyle Scott handles operations.

What is “alignment”? ML systems can exhibit goal-directed behavior, but it is difficult to understand or control what they are “trying” to do. Powerful models could cause harm if they were trying to manipulate and deceive humans. The goal of intent alignment is to instead train these models to be helpful and honest.

Motivation: We believe that modern ML techniques would lead to severe misalignment if scaled up to large enough computers and datasets. Practitioners may be able to adapt before these failures have catastrophic consequences, but we could reduce the risk by adopting scalable methods further in advance.

What we’re working on: The best way to understand our research priorities and methodology is probably to read our report on Eliciting Latent Knowledge. At a high level, we’re trying to figure out how to train ML systems to answer questions by straightforwardly “translating” their beliefs into natural language rather than by reasoning about what a human wants to hear.

Methodology: We’re unsatisfied with an algorithm if we can see any plausible story about how it eventually breaks down, which means that we can rule out most algorithms on paper without ever implementing them. The cost of this approach is that it may completely miss strategies that exploit important structure in realistic ML models; the benefit is that you can consider lots of ideas quickly. (More)

Future plans: We expect to focus on similar theoretical problems in alignment until we either become more pessimistic about tractability or ARC grows enough to branch out into other areas. Over the long term we are likely to work on a combination of theoretical and empirical alignment research, collaborations with industry labs, alignment forecasting, and ML deployment policy.`,

At the same time, identity politics and political polarization have reached new extremes, and social trends such as family stability and crime are worse than in previous decades and in some cases moving in the wrong direction. What explains these trends, and how can we reverse them?

    Much of the blame lies with the institutions we rely on for administration, innovation, and leadership. Instead of forward-looking governments, we have short-sighted politicians and bloated bureaucracies. Instead of real experts with proven track records, we have so-called ‘experts’ who appeal to the authority of their credentials. Instead of political leaders willing to face facts and make tough tradeoffs, we have politicians who appeal to ignorance and defer responsibility.

    To fix our institutions, we need to rethink them from the ground up. That is why CSPI supports and funds research into the administrative systems, organizational structures, and political ideologies of modern governance. Only by understanding what makes these systems so often dysfunctional can we change them for the better.

    CSPI believes that governments should be accountable to the populace as a whole, not special interest groups. We think experts should have greater say in public policy, but that there should be different standards for what qualifies as “expertise.” We want to end scientific and technological stagnation and usher in a new era of growth and innovation.

    We are interested in funding and supporting research that can speak to these issues in the social sciences through grants and fellowships.

    description: `Although the natural world is a source of great beauty and happiness, vast numbers of animals routinely face serious challenges such as disease, hunger, or natural disasters. There is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to these threats. However, even as we recognize that improving the welfare of free-ranging wild animals is difficult, we believe that humans have a responsibility to help whenever we can.

Our staff explores how humans can beneficially coexist with animals through the lens of wild animal welfare.

We respect wild animals as individuals with their own needs and preferences, rather than seeing them as mere parts of ecosystems. But this approach demands a richer understanding of wild animals’ lives.

We want to take a proactive approach to managing the welfare benefits, threats, and uncertainties that are inherent to complex natural and urban environments. Yet, to take action safely, we must conduct research to understand the impacts of our actions. The transdisciplinary perspective of wild animal welfare draws upon ethics, ecology, and animal welfare science to gather the knowledge we need, facilitating evidence-based improvements to wild animals’ quality of life.

Without sufficient public interest or research activity, solutions to the problems wild animals face will go undiscovered.

Wild Animal Initiative currently focuses on helping scientists, grantors, and decision-makers investigate important and understudied questions about wild animal welfare. Our work catalyzes research and applied projects that will open the door to a clearer picture of wild animals’ needs and how to enhance their well-being. Ultimately, we envision a world in which people actively choose to help wild animals — and have the knowledge they need to do so responsibly.`,

    THREE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACLU
•	We protect American values. In many ways, the ACLU is the nation's most conservative organization. Our job is to conserve America's original civic values - the Constitution and the Bill of Rights - and defend the rights of every man, woman and child in this country.
•	We're not anti-anything. The only things we fight are attempts to take away or limit your civil liberties, like your right to practice any religion you want (or none at all); or to decide in private whether or not to have a child; or to speak out - for or against - anything at all; or to be treated with equality and fairness, no matter who you are.
•	We're there for you. Rich or poor, straight or gay, black or white or brown, urban or rural, pious or atheist, American-born or foreign-born, able-bodied or living with a disability. Every person in this country should have the same basic rights. And since our founding in 1920, we've been working hard to make sure no one takes them away.

The American Civil Liberties Union is our nation's guardian of liberty, working daily in courts, legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country.

"So long as we have enough people in this country willing to fight for their rights, we'll be called a democracy," ACLU Founder Roger Baldwin said.

The U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights trumpet our aspirations for the kind of society that we want to be. But for much of our history, our nation failed to fulfill the promise of liberty for whole groups of people.`,

Access to information can enable more enlightened, empowered, and emancipated decisions, just as deprivation of information can confine, control, and coerce our choices.

    The Society Library is a nonpartisan, nonprofit institution dedicated to improving humanity’s relationship to information. We serve this mission by offering tools and services to support humanity’s ability to overcome the internal and external biasing forces that corrupt our ability to make more informed, inclusive, and free choices. External forces include information being inaccessible (due to echo chambers, de-platforming, agenda-setting, etc.), information being corrupted (mis/disinformation, propaganda, biased language, etc.), information being obfuscated (overwhelming technical complexity, jargon, etc.), and there simply being too much information scattered across the web and world to make sense of. Internal forces include our own cognitive biases and logically fallacious thinking processes that corrupt our sensemaking.

    The Society Library dreams of a future when every human on earth inherits a library of the collective ideas, ideologies, and world-views of humanity, so they may more willfully choose to adopt or adapt beliefs, instead of more randomly or blindly inheriting ideas generationally based on limitations like geographic location, economic status, political socialization, and culture. We see a future in which freedom of thought and belief is deeply honored, and when people’s beliefs conflict, humanity has the tools to functionally negotiate those differences in a manner that maximizes freedom in being. People currently have the human right of freedom of thought and belief (Human Right #18 and #19), but to truly make that possible, we need to make information more accessible in every possible way.

The research we conduct is interdisciplinary, particularly across economics, history, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. We focus on empirical questions, such as how the moral circle has expanded historically, what people’s moral circles look like today, and the factors that influence people’s moral circles, but also work on some conceptual questions to clarify concepts such as sentience and moral circle expansion. Historically, we have focused on farmed animals; we now allocate a substantial proportion of our resources to address questions related to artificial sentience.

Our research has many different routes to impact, often referred to as the “Theory of Change.” Most directly, we aim to discover the factors (e.g., activism and business strategies) that most lead to moral circle expansion, but we also aim to understand the nature of moral progress (e.g., How do more people become longtermist?) and evaluate the extent to which certain moral and social outcomes should be prioritized by those trying to do the most good (i.e., “global priorities research”). This helps activists, donors, investors, governments, firms, and other stakeholders working on these issues knowledge to implement strategies that will change social norms and implement more morally inclusive laws and policies. While we mainly focus on institutional change, we expect our research will also help organizations working on changing individual behavior. Because of our longtermist perspective, we are interested in helping develop social movements and organizations that can take action many years from now.

Where appropriate, we publish our research in academic journals, which helps communicate our findings to academics and encourages other researchers to carry out similar research. Our research sometimes attracts media attention, which we expect also has positive effects by informing public opinion and promoting more morally inclusive social norms. Usually, stakeholders see our research via email or directly on our website.`,

    description: `MIRI’s mission is to ensure that the creation of smarter-than-human intelligence has a positive impact. We aim to make advanced intelligent systems behave as we intend even in the absence of immediate human supervision.

    MIRI focuses on AI approaches that can be made transparent (e.g., precisely specified decision algorithms, not genetic algorithms), so that humans can understand why AI systems behave as they do. For safety purposes, a mathematical equation defining general intelligence is more desirable than an impressive but poorly-understood code kludge.

Much of our research is therefore aimed at putting theoretical foundations under AI robustness work. We consider settings where traditional decision and probability theory frequently break down: settings where computation is expensive, there is no sharp agent/environment boundary, multiple agents exist, or self-referential reasoning is admitted.

Using training data to teach advanced AI systems what we value looks more promising than trying to code in everything we care about by hand. However, we know very little about how to discern when training data is unrepresentative of the agent’s future environment, or how to ensure that the agent not only learns about our values but accepts them as its own.

Additionally, rational agents pursuing some goal have an incentive to protect their goal-content. No matter what their current goal is, it will very likely be better served if the agent continues to promote it than if the agent changes goals. This suggests that it may be difficult to improve an agent’s alignment with human interests over time, particularly when the agent is smart enough to model and adapt to its programmers’ goals. Making value learning systems error-tolerant is likely to be necessary for safe online learning.

In addition to our mathematical research, MIRI investigates important strategic questions. What can (and can’t) we predict about the future of AI? How can we improve our forecasting ability? Which interventions available today appear to be the most beneficial, given what little we do know?`,

The intended audience includes researchers doing work related to artificial intelligence, philanthropists involved in funding research related to artificial intelligence, and policy-makers whose decisions may be influenced by their expectations about artificial intelligence.

The focus is particularly on the long-term impacts of sophisticated artificial intelligence. Although human-level AI may be far in the future, there are a number of important questions which we can try to address today and may have implications for contemporary decisions. For example:

- What should we believe about timelines for AI development?
- How rapid is the development of AI likely to be near human-level? How much advance notice should we expect to have of disruptive change?
- What are the likely economic impacts of human-level AI?
- Which paths to AI should be considered plausible or likely?
- Will human-level AI tend to pursue particular goals, and if so what kinds of goals?
- Can we say anything meaningful about the impact of contemporary choices on long-term outcomes?

Today, public discussion on these issues appears to be highly fragmented and of limited credibility. More credible and clearly communicated views on these issues might help improve estimates of the social returns to AI investment, identify neglected research areas, improve policy, or productively channel public interest in AI.

The goal of the project is to clearly present and organize the considerations which inform contemporary views on these and related issues, to identify and explore disagreements, and to assemble whatever empirical evidence is relevant.

2. Pandemic prevention. A lot of people have heard of the Far-UVC light idea; however, understanding why it works, and whether it works safely, is useful for developing other broad-spectrum viral prevention tools, as well as preventing the engineering of UV-resistant viruses.
3. Diagnostic development. We're interested in designing a low-cost and simple-to-use platform for LAMP reactions so that generalized diagnostic capabilities are more widespread.

    description: `~400 billion shrimps are farmed each year. This is more than 5x the total number of all farmed land animals put together. Many of them suffer from conditions which can and should be addressed, such as:
Risk of disease - Diseases that exist within the normal microflora of shrimps can thrive under high stocking densities, enabling pathogenic outbreaks. This is detrimental not only to the farmed shrimps but can cause large spillover events if best management practices are not followed. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics to stop diseases promotes the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Part of the solution in this case is prevention through best welfare practices.

Water quality - Oxygen and ammonia levels, temperature, salinity and pH are key to the welfare of all aquatic animals, including shrimps. Incorrect water management can lead to not only the contamination of nearby bodies of water and salinization and acidification of the soil, but also to compromised immune systems in shrimps and, in extreme cases, to death by suffocation or poisoning.

Eyestalk ablation - Some hatcheries still practice crushing or cutting off the eyestalk of female shrimps to induce rapid maturation. Recent studies have demonstrated that avoiding eyestalk ablation can result in broodstock living longer and their offspring being more resistant to stress. Therefore, eliminating this practice is in the best interest of shrimps but also of the shrimp farming industry.

They are highly neglected. Shrimp Welfare Project is the first organization focusing exclusively on the welfare of these animals. This has been made possible, in part, thanks to organizations such as Charity Entrepreneurship and Rethink Priorities raising the issue of invertebrate suffering.

      'Foresight Institute supports the beneficial development of high-impact technology to make great futures more likely.',
    description: `Foresight Institute is a research organization and non-profit that supports the beneficial development of high-impact technologies. Since our founding in 1986 on a vision of guiding powerful technologies, we have continued to evolve into a many-armed organization that focuses on several fields of science and technology that are too ambitious for legacy institutions to support. From molecular nanotechnology, to brain-computer interfaces, space exploration, cryptocommerce, and AI, Foresight gathers leading minds to advance research and accelerate progress toward flourishing futures.

A core part of Foresight’s work is to host technical groups: Molecular Machines to better control matter; Biotech to reverse aging; Computer Science to secure human AI cooperation; Neurotech to support human flourishing; Spacetech to further exploration. In these groups, we connect scientists, entrepreneurs, and institutional allies who cooperate to advance the respective technologies. Currently, meetings take place virtually every month. Most of the meetings are made publicly available via our Youtube or podcast, and are written into seminar summaries including slides, videos and any additional material to the talks that you can find on the respective page.

Foresight regularly hosts monthly in-person meetups across the globe, to offer like-minded people all over the world an opportunity to find each other and join our community. If you work in science and tech and want the future to go well, you should apply to join our meetups! Currently we are hosting in cities such as San Francisco, NYC, LA, Berlin, London, Stockholm, Zurich, Toronto, Paris, Miami, Austin, Singapore, Boston, Phuket/Rawai, Seattle, Dubai, Philadelphia and Lisbon.

Foresight’s biggest event every year is our annual member gathering Vision Weekend. This conference festival is hosted at the end of the year in the United State of America and in France. We invite top talent across biotechnology, nanotechnology, neurotechnology, computing, and space to burst their tech silos, and plan for flourishing long-term futures. Previously we have hosted this event in locations such as The Internet Archive, a space company, an old military ship and at a beautiful old castle in France.

We also host several technical conferences every year, inviting top researchers, entrepreneurs, and funders to highlight undervalued areas for progress. In addition to learning about undervalued opportunities for progress relevant to your field, and forming lasting collaborations with other leading scientists, entrepreneurs, and funders around shared goals, we hope that these workshops will generate direction and drive toward shared long-term goals.

      'Legal Impact for Chickens aims to make factory-farm cruelty a liability.',
    description: `Legal Impact for Chickens focuses on civil litigation as a way to improve animal welfare.

Why? Companies don’t follow laws that aren’t enforced. And prosecutors rarely enforce cruelty laws on factory farms, even when animal protection groups urge them to.

As a result, while several state cruelty laws technically cover farms, factory farms ignore them. Investigations in such states show rampant, unlawful neglect and abuse. Similarly, the animal movement’s effort to pass confinement bans may be wasted if those new bans aren’t enforced.

Strategic civil litigation offers a solution. Several little-known legal doctrines let plaintiffs sue in civil court for violation of a criminal law. At Legal Impact for Chickens, we focus on systematically developing, refining, and using those doctrines to fight factory-farm cruelty.

    description: `Freedom of speech is a fundamental American freedom and human right. It is essential for democracy, scientific progress, artistic expression, social justice, peace, and our ability to live as authentic individuals.

Yet, across our nation, this cornerstone of our free society is under serious threat. Far too many of us fear sharing our views or challenging those that seem to dominate. Nearly 6-in-10 Americans believe our nation’s democracy is threatened because people are afraid to voice their opinions.

FIRE therefore defends and promotes the value of free speech for all Americans in our courtrooms, on our campuses, and in our culture. Our vision is an America in which people overwhelmingly believe in the right of others to freely express views different from their own, and expect their laws and educational institutions to reflect and teach this belief.`,
