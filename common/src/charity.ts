    description: `(By Zvi Mowshowitz)

If we do not address the deep dysfunctions of our government and its policies, we put our democracy and entire civilization at risk. People whose lives are getting worse, who have no hope and cannot envision a future, inevitably turn to authoritarianism. A focus on telling people how terrible and fascist Donald Trump is did not work well in 2016 or 2020 and is not the best way to keep him out of the White House in 2024. It will not help us prosper and overcome political differences. Even if he is kept out in 2024, either we turn things around or things will keep getting worse. 

My new project, together with Moshe Looks and Alyssa Vance, is to chart paths forward to improve federal policy, and lay groundwork to implement those improvements. That means taking into account political feasibility. It means getting the proposals and messaging into the hands of candidates. It means commissioning academic studies quantifying costs and benefits and advance drafting of legislative language. 

Consider the pandemic. Our government’s actions these past two years not only failed to make the pandemic better, they often actively made the pandemic worse while spending trillions. Our response to a potential next pandemic, monkeypox, was similarly botched. 

Some of my most read posts point out clear cases where the government makes things worse, like car seat mandates so bad they serve as contraception, a law that makes it impossible to maintain modern ports in working order for basically no reason, and rules against container stacking that did major damage to our supply chains. 

A few years ago I would have left such tasks to ‘the adults in the room.’ There are no such adults. Someone has to, and no one else will. If you tell me someone is already on the case and Doing the Thing, this means little. The situation is not ‘handled.’ Elites have lost all credibility.

I also believe that almost all existing organizations nominally dedicated to such purposes face poor incentive structures due to how they are funded and garner attention, and are not testing the hypothesis that the problem could be solved. I will test that hypothesis. 

There is far more hope for improvement than almost anyone realizes. Lobbying when done right is remarkably cheap and effective. Secret congress can be productive. Many marginal improvements are highly valuable, with no substantial downsides and compounding benefits. 

Low-hanging improvement is often as simple as not restricting supply and not subsidizing demand. A sample: Reforming NEPA, the NRC, zoning and the FDA including a right to try for drugs, pandemic preparedness, repealing protectionist policies (Jones Act, Dredge Act, ‘made in America’, etc), ending qualified immunity and civil forfeiture, legalizing marijuana, avoiding 100%+ marginal tax rates, increasing high-skill immigration, fixing student loans, and NGDP level targeting by the Federal Reserve. The civil service and procurement urgently need reform. 

Campaigns bleed tons of value all the time, leaving large room for improvement. Big mistakes made the difference in 2016, almost did in 2020 and are likely again in the future.

We need your help - growing the team, engineering new software, analyzing policy space, finding experts, making connections, commissioning academic studies, drafting laws, writing up results, refining messaging, ultimately lobbying and working with campaigns, and of course raising money.

    description: `1Day Sooner is a non-profit that advocates on behalf of COVID-19 challenge trial volunteers.
      
    After a vaccine candidate is created in a lab, it is developed through a combination of pre-clinical evaluation and three phases of clinical trials that test its safety and efficacy. In traditional Phase III trials, participants receive the vaccine candidate or a placebo/active comparator, and efficacy is judged by comparing the prevalence of infection in the vaccine group and the placebo/comparator group, to test the hypothesis that significantly fewer participants in the vaccine group get infected. In these traditional trials, after receiving the treatment, participants return to their homes and their normal daily lives so as to test the treatment under real world conditions. Since only a small proportion of these participants may encounter the disease, it may take a large number of participants and a good deal of time for these trials to reveal differences between the vaccine and placebo groups.
      
    In a human challenge trial (HCT), willing participants would receive the vaccine candidate or placebo and, after some time for the vaccine to take effect, be deliberately exposed to live coronavirus. Since exposure to the virus is guaranteed in HCTs, it may be possible to judge a vaccine candidate’s efficacy more quickly and with far fewer participants than a standard Phase III trial. While HCT efficacy results do not traditionally provide sufficient basis for licensure on their own, they could allow us to (1) more quickly weed out disappointing vaccine candidates or (2) promote the development of promising candidates in conjunction with traditional Phase III studies.
      
    In addition, by gathering detailed data on the process of infection and vaccine protection in a clinical setting, researchers could learn information that proves extremely useful for broader vaccine and therapeutic development efforts. Altogether, there are scenarios in which the speed of HCTs and the richness of the data they provide accelerate the development of an effective and broadly accessible COVID-19 vaccine, with thousands of lives spared (depending on the pandemic’s long-term trajectory).`,

    description: `ARC is a non-profit research organization whose mission is to align future machine learning systems with human interests. Its current work focuses on developing an alignment strategy that could be adopted in industry today while scaling gracefully to future ML systems. Right now Paul Christiano and Mark Xu are researchers and Kyle Scott handles operations.

What is “alignment”? ML systems can exhibit goal-directed behavior, but it is difficult to understand or control what they are “trying” to do. Powerful models could cause harm if they were trying to manipulate and deceive humans. The goal of intent alignment is to instead train these models to be helpful and honest.

Motivation: We believe that modern ML techniques would lead to severe misalignment if scaled up to large enough computers and datasets. Practitioners may be able to adapt before these failures have catastrophic consequences, but we could reduce the risk by adopting scalable methods further in advance.

What we’re working on: The best way to understand our research priorities and methodology is probably to read our report on Eliciting Latent Knowledge. At a high level, we’re trying to figure out how to train ML systems to answer questions by straightforwardly “translating” their beliefs into natural language rather than by reasoning about what a human wants to hear.

Methodology: We’re unsatisfied with an algorithm if we can see any plausible story about how it eventually breaks down, which means that we can rule out most algorithms on paper without ever implementing them. The cost of this approach is that it may completely miss strategies that exploit important structure in realistic ML models; the benefit is that you can consider lots of ideas quickly. (More)

Future plans: We expect to focus on similar theoretical problems in alignment until we either become more pessimistic about tractability or ARC grows enough to branch out into other areas. Over the long term we are likely to work on a combination of theoretical and empirical alignment research, collaborations with industry labs, alignment forecasting, and ML deployment policy.`,

At the same time, identity politics and political polarization have reached new extremes, and social trends such as family stability and crime are worse than in previous decades and in some cases moving in the wrong direction. What explains these trends, and how can we reverse them?

    Much of the blame lies with the institutions we rely on for administration, innovation, and leadership. Instead of forward-looking governments, we have short-sighted politicians and bloated bureaucracies. Instead of real experts with proven track records, we have so-called ‘experts’ who appeal to the authority of their credentials. Instead of political leaders willing to face facts and make tough tradeoffs, we have politicians who appeal to ignorance and defer responsibility.
    
    To fix our institutions, we need to rethink them from the ground up. That is why CSPI supports and funds research into the administrative systems, organizational structures, and political ideologies of modern governance. Only by understanding what makes these systems so often dysfunctional can we change them for the better.

    description: `Although the natural world is a source of great beauty and happiness, vast numbers of animals routinely face serious challenges such as disease, hunger, or natural disasters. There is no “one-size-fits-all” solution to these threats. However, even as we recognize that improving the welfare of free-ranging wild animals is difficult, we believe that humans have a responsibility to help whenever we can.

Our staff explores how humans can beneficially coexist with animals through the lens of wild animal welfare. 

We respect wild animals as individuals with their own needs and preferences, rather than seeing them as mere parts of ecosystems. But this approach demands a richer understanding of wild animals’ lives. 

We want to take a proactive approach to managing the welfare benefits, threats, and uncertainties that are inherent to complex natural and urban environments. Yet, to take action safely, we must conduct research to understand the impacts of our actions. The transdisciplinary perspective of wild animal welfare draws upon ethics, ecology, and animal welfare science to gather the knowledge we need, facilitating evidence-based improvements to wild animals’ quality of life.

Without sufficient public interest or research activity, solutions to the problems wild animals face will go undiscovered. 

Wild Animal Initiative currently focuses on helping scientists, grantors, and decision-makers investigate important and understudied questions about wild animal welfare. Our work catalyzes research and applied projects that will open the door to a clearer picture of wild animals’ needs and how to enhance their well-being. Ultimately, we envision a world in which people actively choose to help wild animals — and have the knowledge they need to do so responsibly.`,

    THREE THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT THE ACLU
•	We protect American values. In many ways, the ACLU is the nation's most conservative organization. Our job is to conserve America's original civic values - the Constitution and the Bill of Rights - and defend the rights of every man, woman and child in this country.
•	We're not anti-anything. The only things we fight are attempts to take away or limit your civil liberties, like your right to practice any religion you want (or none at all); or to decide in private whether or not to have a child; or to speak out - for or against - anything at all; or to be treated with equality and fairness, no matter who you are.
•	We're there for you. Rich or poor, straight or gay, black or white or brown, urban or rural, pious or atheist, American-born or foreign-born, able-bodied or living with a disability. Every person in this country should have the same basic rights. And since our founding in 1920, we've been working hard to make sure no one takes them away.

The American Civil Liberties Union is our nation's guardian of liberty, working daily in courts, legislatures and communities to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties that the Constitution and laws of the United States guarantee everyone in this country.

"So long as we have enough people in this country willing to fight for their rights, we'll be called a democracy," ACLU Founder Roger Baldwin said.

The U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights trumpet our aspirations for the kind of society that we want to be. But for much of our history, our nation failed to fulfill the promise of liberty for whole groups of people.`,

Access to information can enable more enlightened, empowered, and emancipated decisions, just as deprivation of information can confine, control, and coerce our choices.

    The Society Library is a nonpartisan, nonprofit institution dedicated to improving humanity’s relationship to information. We serve this mission by offering tools and services to support humanity’s ability to overcome the internal and external biasing forces that corrupt our ability to make more informed, inclusive, and free choices. External forces include information being inaccessible (due to echo chambers, de-platforming, agenda-setting, etc.), information being corrupted (mis/disinformation, propaganda, biased language, etc.), information being obfuscated (overwhelming technical complexity, jargon, etc.), and there simply being too much information scattered across the web and world to make sense of. Internal forces include our own cognitive biases and logically fallacious thinking processes that corrupt our sensemaking.

    The Society Library dreams of a future when every human on earth inherits a library of the collective ideas, ideologies, and world-views of humanity, so they may more willfully choose to adopt or adapt beliefs, instead of more randomly or blindly inheriting ideas generationally based on limitations like geographic location, economic status, political socialization, and culture. We see a future in which freedom of thought and belief is deeply honored, and when people’s beliefs conflict, humanity has the tools to functionally negotiate those differences in a manner that maximizes freedom in being. People currently have the human right of freedom of thought and belief (Human Right #18 and #19), but to truly make that possible, we need to make information more accessible in every possible way.

The research we conduct is interdisciplinary, particularly across economics, history, philosophy, psychology, and sociology. We focus on empirical questions, such as how the moral circle has expanded historically, what people’s moral circles look like today, and the factors that influence people’s moral circles, but also work on some conceptual questions to clarify concepts such as sentience and moral circle expansion. Historically, we have focused on farmed animals; we now allocate a substantial proportion of our resources to address questions related to artificial sentience.

Our research has many different routes to impact, often referred to as the “Theory of Change.” Most directly, we aim to discover the factors (e.g., activism and business strategies) that most lead to moral circle expansion, but we also aim to understand the nature of moral progress (e.g., How do more people become longtermist?) and evaluate the extent to which certain moral and social outcomes should be prioritized by those trying to do the most good (i.e., “global priorities research”). This helps activists, donors, investors, governments, firms, and other stakeholders working on these issues knowledge to implement strategies that will change social norms and implement more morally inclusive laws and policies. While we mainly focus on institutional change, we expect our research will also help organizations working on changing individual behavior. Because of our longtermist perspective, we are interested in helping develop social movements and organizations that can take action many years from now.

Where appropriate, we publish our research in academic journals, which helps communicate our findings to academics and encourages other researchers to carry out similar research. Our research sometimes attracts media attention, which we expect also has positive effects by informing public opinion and promoting more morally inclusive social norms. Usually, stakeholders see our research via email or directly on our website.`,

    MIRI focuses on AI approaches that can be made transparent (e.g., precisely specified decision algorithms, not genetic algorithms), so that humans can understand why AI systems behave as they do. For safety purposes, a mathematical equation defining general intelligence is more desirable than an impressive but poorly-understood code kludge.

Much of our research is therefore aimed at putting theoretical foundations under AI robustness work. We consider settings where traditional decision and probability theory frequently break down: settings where computation is expensive, there is no sharp agent/environment boundary, multiple agents exist, or self-referential reasoning is admitted.

Using training data to teach advanced AI systems what we value looks more promising than trying to code in everything we care about by hand. However, we know very little about how to discern when training data is unrepresentative of the agent’s future environment, or how to ensure that the agent not only learns about our values but accepts them as its own.

Additionally, rational agents pursuing some goal have an incentive to protect their goal-content. No matter what their current goal is, it will very likely be better served if the agent continues to promote it than if the agent changes goals. This suggests that it may be difficult to improve an agent’s alignment with human interests over time, particularly when the agent is smart enough to model and adapt to its programmers’ goals. Making value learning systems error-tolerant is likely to be necessary for safe online learning.

In addition to our mathematical research, MIRI investigates important strategic questions. What can (and can’t) we predict about the future of AI? How can we improve our forecasting ability? Which interventions available today appear to be the most beneficial, given what little we do know?`,

The intended audience includes researchers doing work related to artificial intelligence, philanthropists involved in funding research related to artificial intelligence, and policy-makers whose decisions may be influenced by their expectations about artificial intelligence.

The focus is particularly on the long-term impacts of sophisticated artificial intelligence. Although human-level AI may be far in the future, there are a number of important questions which we can try to address today and may have implications for contemporary decisions. For example:

- What should we believe about timelines for AI development?
- How rapid is the development of AI likely to be near human-level? How much advance notice should we expect to have of disruptive change?
- What are the likely economic impacts of human-level AI?
- Which paths to AI should be considered plausible or likely?
- Will human-level AI tend to pursue particular goals, and if so what kinds of goals?
- Can we say anything meaningful about the impact of contemporary choices on long-term outcomes?

Today, public discussion on these issues appears to be highly fragmented and of limited credibility. More credible and clearly communicated views on these issues might help improve estimates of the social returns to AI investment, identify neglected research areas, improve policy, or productively channel public interest in AI.

The goal of the project is to clearly present and organize the considerations which inform contemporary views on these and related issues, to identify and explore disagreements, and to assemble whatever empirical evidence is relevant.

For instance, we know how to induce provable guarantees of behaviour in supervised learning; could we do something similar in RL?
2. Pandemic prevention. A lot of people have heard of the Far-UVC light idea; however, understanding why it works, and whether it works safely, is useful for developing other broad-spectrum viral prevention tools, as well as preventing the engineering of UV-resistant viruses.
3. Diagnostic development. We're interested in designing a low-cost and simple-to-use platform for LAMP reactions so that generalized diagnostic capabilities are more widespread.

    description: `~400 billion shrimps are farmed each year. This is more than 5x the total number of all farmed land animals put together. Many of them suffer from conditions which can and should be addressed, such as:
Risk of disease - Diseases that exist within the normal microflora of shrimps can thrive under high stocking densities, enabling pathogenic outbreaks. This is detrimental not only to the farmed shrimps but can cause large spillover events if best management practices are not followed. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics to stop diseases promotes the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Part of the solution in this case is prevention through best welfare practices.

Water quality - Oxygen and ammonia levels, temperature, salinity and pH are key to the welfare of all aquatic animals, including shrimps. Incorrect water management can lead to not only the contamination of nearby bodies of water and salinization and acidification of the soil, but also to compromised immune systems in shrimps and, in extreme cases, to death by suffocation or poisoning.

Eyestalk ablation - Some hatcheries still practice crushing or cutting off the eyestalk of female shrimps to induce rapid maturation. Recent studies have demonstrated that avoiding eyestalk ablation can result in broodstock living longer and their offspring being more resistant to stress. Therefore, eliminating this practice is in the best interest of shrimps but also of the shrimp farming industry.

They are highly neglected. Shrimp Welfare Project is the first organization focusing exclusively on the welfare of these animals. This has been made possible, in part, thanks to organizations such as Charity Entrepreneurship and Rethink Priorities raising the issue of invertebrate suffering.
