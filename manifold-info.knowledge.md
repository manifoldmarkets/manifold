Manifold is the world's most popular prediction market website.

Manifold lets you bet on upcoming events using play money. As other users bet against you, it creates a probability of how likely the event will happenâ€”this is known as a prediction market.
Bet on current events, politics, tech, and AI, or create your own market about an event you care about for others to trade on!
